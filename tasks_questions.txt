Meetings:
Monday 9 - 10 in the morning exchange functions info ??  -  Max ok, Ranja ok, Nadine ok
Monday from 18 Uhr in the evening coding session  ?? - Max maybe later, Nadine ok



- why cannot compile rl_replace_line with .o files in Makefile?
- parser: complete other valid funcs
- put everything into dir communication/ ?
- do we need a file for information? Share links, share information how to use GitHub?
- delete server discord? - Nadine: I think, the discord server can remain to exchange the tutor video or files, as we can't do it here.


----------------------------
Nadine:
signal - Max and Nadine already done
I could explain the functions:
fork
wait
waitpid
dup2
pipe
as I had them in the pipex project, okay?! (ok max)

We have two main files, one in the src directory and one in the generall directory, I will delete the main from generall directory,
because it was very first main and it has only first try with the readline function. (ok max)


Nick:
-delete Headers in all files
+ A task that is done ??? Do we need this? - Nadine: I think, we don't need the headers in the git version.


Ranja: (research)
readline - Max and Nadine already done
rl_clear_history - 
rl_on_new_line -
rl_replace_line - 
rl_redisplay -
add_histroy - Max and Nadine already done
Remove headers from libft libary - Nadine: is that a suggestion, qiestion or someone did it alread?!


Max:
- how can you browse through the commits?
- how to push, pull, merge etc. 
- delete discord server and get the important messages
